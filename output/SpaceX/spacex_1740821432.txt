SpaceX has successfully deployed its latest batch of Starlink satellites into orbit, bringing the total number to over 2,000. The ambitious internet constellation project aims to provide affordable high-speed internet to the world, particularly to remote and underserved areas. While some astronomers have raised concerns about the impact on stargazing, SpaceX insists its satellites are designed with sunlight reflectivity in mind to minimize their visibility.
